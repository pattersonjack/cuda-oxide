#![allow(non_snake_case)]
//! CUDA thread intrinsics and thread-safe index types.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - `ThreadIndex<'kernel, IndexSpace>`: a typed witness derived from
//!   hardware built-in variables, with a `'kernel` lifetime that pins it
//!   to the kernel body
//! - Thread intrinsics: `threadIdx_x`, `blockIdx_x`, etc.
//! - Index helpers: `index_1d`, `index_2d::<S>`, `unsafe index_2d_runtime`
//!   that return typed `ThreadIndex` witnesses
//! - `IndexFormula`: a marker trait for index spaces that can be derived
//!   from the kernel scope alone (used by `DisjointSlice::get_mut_indexed`)
//!
//! # Safety Model
//!
//! The safety of parallel writes to `DisjointSlice` relies on each thread
//! accessing a unique memory location. This is guaranteed as follows:
//!
//! 1. **ThreadIndex** can only be constructed by trusted functions:
//!    `index_1d()`, `index_2d::<S>()`, and the unsafe `index_2d_runtime(s)`.
//! 2. These functions derive the index from hardware built-in variables
//!    (`threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, `blockDim`) -- read-only special registers
//!    assigned by the runtime at kernel launch. The formula
//!    `outer * stride + inner` combines these into a scalar index per thread.
//! 3. `index_1d`: unique per thread only for a 1D launch
//!    (`blockDim.y == blockDim.z == 1` and `gridDim.y == gridDim.z == 1`). It
//!    reads only the X registers, so a 2D/3D launch collides; see issue #115.
//! 4. `index_2d::<S>()`: unique per thread for const-stride 2D grids.
//!    The stride lives in the witness type, and `DisjointSlice` only
//!    accepts indices from the matching index space -- mismatched
//!    strides are a compile error.
//! 5. `unsafe index_2d_runtime(s)`: caller asserts every thread used the
//!    same `s`. The type system can't prove uniformity for runtime
//!    strides; the `unsafe` keyword is the contract.
//! 6. The witness is `!Send + !Sync + !Copy + !Clone` and `'kernel`-scoped,
//!    so threads can't launder it through shared memory and it can't
//!    outlive the kernel body.

/// - [`index_2d_runtime()`] — unsafe runtime-stride escape hatch
///
/// # Where you can call them
///
/// The `'kernel` scope only exists inside `#[kernel]` and `#[device]`
/// bodies, which has two practical consequences:
///
/// - **Plain `fn` device helpers (no annotation)** can't acquire a
///   `ThreadIndex`. The public `thread::index_*` items are `unreachable!`
///   stubs — they compile and import fine, but calling one outside an
///   annotated body panics on first call. The macros rewrite real
///   call sites to `thread::__internal::*`, which is what actually runs
///   on the device. If a helper needs an index, take it as a parameter.
/// - **`#[device]` fns** *can* call `thread::index_*`, but they can't
///   return the resulting `ThreadIndex` — `'kernel` is borrowed from the
///   helper's local scope and dies at function exit. Use the witness
///   inside the helper. (`#[device]` is mainly for FFI exports via
///   LTOIR, where this restriction doesn't bite.)
///
/// # Reserved names inside `#[kernel]` and `#[device]`
///
/// The macros rewrite a small set of names inside annotated bodies so
/// the user never has to thread the kernel scope through by hand:
///
/// - free functions: `index_1d`, `index_2d`, `index_2d_runtime`
/// - methods (zero-arg call sites): `get_mut_indexed`
///
/// Free-function calls are matched on path tail, so all of these resolve
/// to the same intrinsic:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// thread::index_1d()
/// cuda_device::thread::index_1d()
/// use cuda_device::thread::index_1d;  index_1d()
/// use cuda_device::thread::index_1d as get_idx;  get_idx() // not rewritten — alias
/// ```
///
/// Method calls are matched on the method name only — `slice.get_mut_indexed()`
/// has the kernel scope spliced in as the (currently invisible)
/// `&KernelScope` argument the method actually takes.
///
/// The trade-off: if you define a local `fn index_1d` (or any of the
/// other reserved names) and call it from inside `#[kernel]` or
/// `#[device]`, the macro will silently rewrite that call too. Pick a
/// different name (e.g. `compute_index_1d`, `pop_indexed`) for any

///
/// **Proof sketch (within one stride):** Two threads with distinct
/// `(row_a, col_a)` and `(row_b, col_b)` where both `col_a < stride` and

///
/// ```text
///   row_a * stride + col_a == row_b * stride + col_b
///   => (row_a - row_b) * stride == col_b - col_a
/// ```
///
/// `col_a, col_b ∈ [0, stride)`, so the RHS is in `(-stride, stride)`.

// =============================================================================

/// Block-level thread synchronization barrier.
///
/// All threads in a block must reach this barrier before any thread can proceed.
/// This is equivalent to `__syncthreads()` in CUDA C/C++.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cuda_device::thread;
///
/// // Write to shared memory
/// shared_tile[tid] = value;
///
/// // Ensure all threads have written before any thread reads
/// thread::sync_threads();
///
/// // Now safe to read values written by other threads
/// let neighbor = shared_tile[other_tid];
/// ```
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - All threads in the block must reach the same barrier (no divergent barriers)
/// - Placing `sync_threads()` inside a conditional where not all threads enter
///   will cause deadlock

// Compile-Time Launch Bounds Configuration
// =============================================================================

/// Marker function for compile-time launch bounds configuration.
///
/// This is a compile-time configuration marker that tells the compiler to emit
/// `.maxntid` and `.minnctapersm` PTX directives for this kernel. It does NOT
/// generate any runtime code.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This function should NOT be called directly. Use the `#[launch_bounds(max, min)]`
/// attribute macro instead, which injects this marker:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// #[kernel]
/// #[launch_bounds(256)]           // max 256 threads per block
/// pub fn my_kernel(output: DisjointSlice<f32>) { ... }
///
/// #[kernel]
/// #[launch_bounds(256, 2)]        // max 256 threads, min 2 blocks per SM
/// pub fn optimized_kernel(output: DisjointSlice<f32>) { ... }
/// ```
///
/// # How It Works
///
/// 1. The `#[launch_bounds]` macro injects `__launch_bounds_config::<MAX, MIN>()` at kernel start
/// 2. MIR importer detects this call and extracts the const generic parameters
/// 3. The marker call is NOT compiled - it's removed during compilation
/// 4. LLVM export emits `!nvvm.annotations` with `maxntid` and `minctasm` metadata
/// 5. LLVM NVPTX backend emits `.maxntid` and `.minnctapersm` in PTX
///
/// # PTX Output
///
/// ```ptx
/// .entry my_kernel .maxntid 256 .minnctapersm 2 { ... }
/// ```
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `MAX_THREADS` - Maximum threads per block (required). Maps to `.maxntid`.
/// - `MIN_BLOCKS` - Minimum blocks per SM for occupancy (optional, default 0 = unspecified).
///   Maps to `.minnctapersm`.
///
/// # Performance Impact
///
/// Launch bounds help the compiler:
/// - Allocate registers more efficiently
/// - Optimize occupancy (threads per SM)
/// - Make better scheduling decisions
///
/// Using appropriate launch bounds can significantly improve performance for
/// register-heavy kernels or kernels with specific occupancy requirements.
